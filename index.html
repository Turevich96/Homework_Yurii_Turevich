                    <p class="text_blog"><span>T</span> happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.
                        About twelve
                        o'clock a troop of
                        ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its
                        speed,
                        tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The
                        buffaloes
                        marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                        bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
                        nothing
                        can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could
                        contain.
                    </p>
                    <p>The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the
                        most
                        reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
                        please the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                        Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                        revolvers upon them.</p>
                    <p>What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if
                        they
                        were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
                        programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of
                        beasts!"
                    </p>
                    <q><span class="qvot">"</span> The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.
